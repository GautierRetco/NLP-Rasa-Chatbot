# NLP-Rasa-Chatbot


## Setup
For this bot to work, you'll have to generate the 5go matrix_similarity.pkl file. For this to be done, use the notebook /recommendation-models/final_model.ipynb

Once this is done, you'll need one terminal to run the actions.py file : 
> rasa run actions

And to start Rasa in interactive shell mode, you can run : 
> rasa shell
